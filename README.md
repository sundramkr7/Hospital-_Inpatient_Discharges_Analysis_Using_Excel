# Hospital-_Inpatient_Discharges_Analysis_Using_Excel

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing hospital inpatient discharges using Excel to uncover insights about patient demographics, treatment trends, costs, and outcomes. By leveraging Excel's data manipulation and visualization capabilities, the analysis aims to assist healthcare administrators in making informed decisions to improve hospital performance and patient care.

# Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

1.	Analyze Discharge Data: Identify trends in inpatient discharges by age group, gender, and diagnosis.

2.	Measure Key Metrics: Calculate and visualize metrics such as Average Length of Stay (ALOS), readmission rates, and total charges.

3.	Evaluate Financial Performance: Assess total costs and charges to determine profitability and cost-efficiency.

4.	Visualize Results: Create interactive dashboards to present key findings effectively.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following fields:

•	Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient.

•	Blood_Group: Blood group of patient.

•	Admission Date: Date of hospital admission.

•	Age: Age of the patient.

•	Gender: Gender of the patient.

•	Diagnosis Code: Code representing the patient's diagnosis.

•	Treatment Category: Category of treatment (e.g., General, ICU, Surgery).

•	Facility Name: Name of the hospital.

•	Total Charges: Total charges incurred by the patient during the stay.

# Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

   Removed duplicates and handled missing data.
   
   Converted dates into proper formats for analysis.
   
   Derived calculated fields like Length of Stay and Avg Billing Per Person.

3. Analysis and Calculations

   Length of Stay (LOS)
   
   Avg Billing Per Person
   
   Average Charges and Costs
   
   Discharges by Treatment Category and more.

3. Visualization and Reporting

   Created pivot tables for breakdowns by diagnosis, age, and gender.
   
   Designed charts and dashboards for key metrics like ALOS, charges, and billing per day.

# Key Insights

•	The average length of stay varies significantly across treatment categories, with ICU stays being the longest.

•	From our analysis we identify that no. of patient admission is higher in the month of June followed by November and lowest in the month of July.

•	Based on the above analysis, we observed that the cardiology department generated the highest revenue, followed by the orthopedic department.

•	From our analysis we can clearly say that most used  mode of payment is Medicare followed by Medicaid.
